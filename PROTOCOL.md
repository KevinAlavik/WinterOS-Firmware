# Frost64 Firmware Protocol

## Introduction

Very simple, work in progress

## Firmware Expectations

The firmware is expected to put the processor into protected mode, set-up a basic interrupt handling mechansim, detect and intialise any devices into a reasonable state.

## Loading the bootloader

The first 16 512-byte sectors on the storage device are reserved for the bootloader. The firmware is expected to load the bootloader from the storage device to 0x10000 and jump to it.

## The protocol

The protocol is a simple callback based system. The firmware is expected to provide a table which contains metadata and function pointers for various things.

### Calling conventions

#### Register Saving

- `r0` - `r7` are caller saved.
- `r8` - `r15` are callee saved.
- `stp` shouldn't be modified by the callee.
- `sbp` and `scp` are callee saved.

#### Arguments

- `r0` - `r3` are used for arguments.
- Any further arguments are passed on the stack in reverse order.

#### Return values

- `r0` is used for simple return values.
- `r1` can be used to extend the return value if needed.
- Anything bigger than 16 bytes will need to be either have its address passed as an argument or an address to a buffer gets returned.

#### Prologue

- The callee is expected to create a new stack frame by saving `sbp` to the stack, and then setting it to `scp`.
- This provides hardware level stack underflow/overflow protection.

#### Epilogue

- The callee is expected to restore `sbp` from the stack and then return.

### The table

#### Root table

The table root is expected to contain the following fields:

| Offset | Size | Name      | Description                          |
|--------|------|-----------|--------------------------------------|
| 0x00   | 8    | Magic     | A magic number to identify the table |
| 0x08   | 8    | Ver       | The version of the standard          |
| 0x10   | 8    | Name      | The name of the firmware             |
| 0x18   | 8    | Auth      | The author of the firmware           |
| 0x20   | 8    | FVer      | The version of the firmware          |
| 0x28   | 8    | DevTab    | The address of the device info table |
| 0x30   | 8    | DevTabLen | The length of the device info table  |
| 0x38   | 8    | MemTab    | The address of the memory info table |
| 0x40   | 8    | MemTabLen | The length of the memory info table  |

#### Device info table

The device info table is expected to contain the following fields:

| Offset | Size | Name       | Description                                            |
|--------|------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 0x00   | 8    | Magic      | A magic number to identify the table                   |
| 0x08   | 8    | Ver        | The version of the standard                            |
| 0x10   | 8    | DevNum     | The number of devices                                  |
| 0x18   | 8    | DevGetFunc | The address of the function to get info about a device |

Each device has a unique table which can get retrieved by calling the `DevGetFunc` function pointer with the device number as an argument. The device number is expected to be a 64-bit integer.

##### Device info table for a video device

The remaining fields are expected to be as follows:

| Offset | Size | Name        | Description                                          |
|--------|------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 0x00   | 8    | Width       | The native width of the screen in pixels             |
| 0x08   | 8    | Height      | The native height of the screen in pixels            |
| 0x10   | 8    | Depth       | The native depth of the screen in bits per pixel     |
| 0x18   | 8    | ModeCount   | The number of supported modes                        |
| 0x20   | 8    | ModeGetFunc | The address of the function to get info about a mode |
| 0x80   | 8    | ModeGetFunc | The address of the function to set a mode            |
| 0x88   | 8    | GetFBFunc   | The address of the function to get the framebuffer   |

The table for each mode is expected to be as follows:

| Offset | Size | Name        | Description                               |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
